# 🧩 Maze Adventure Game

This is a 2-level interactive **maze adventure game** that I built using p5.js and p5.play. In this game players will navigate through theme based mazes using arrow keys and win by reaching the end zone.

## 🎮 How to Play

* Press the Start Game button to begin.
* Use arrow keys to move your sprite (⬅️ ⬆️ ➡️ ⬇️).
* Navigate from Start to End without being trapped by the walls.
* Win Level 1 (Grassland) to unlock Level 2 (Sandland).
* Complete all levels to see a "Play Again" option.

## 🌟 Features

There are two uniquely themes maze level 🌿 Grassland and 🏜️ Sandland. The sprite movement is caused by `kb.pressing()` and there are also specially themed backgrounds for each level. The game also includes interactive buttons throughout, such as `Start Game`, `Next Level` and `Play Again`
